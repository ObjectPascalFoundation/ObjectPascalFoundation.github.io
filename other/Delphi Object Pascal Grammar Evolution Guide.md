Because Delphi has maintained strict backward compatibility while
absorbing three decades of modern programming paradigms, its grammar is
highly contextual. This guide details the strict difference between
reserved words and directives, and a comprehensive timeline of when
specific syntax rules were introduced or modified.

### 1. Lexical Grammar: Tokens, Reserved Words, and Directives

At the lexical level, a Delphi program is parsed into tokens separated
by whitespace or comments (which can be enclosed in {}, (\*\*), or //)

A critical challenge when building a Delphi grammar is distinguishing
between **Reserved Words** and **Directives**:

- **Reserved Words:** These keywords (e.g., class, interface, begin,
  end, try, if) have fixed meanings and can never be used as
  user-defined identifiers

- **Directives:** These are contextual keywords (e.g., read, write,
  absolute, dynamic, strict). They trigger specific compiler behaviors
  when placed in designated syntactic locations---like inside a class or
  property declaration---but the parser must allow them to be used as
  standard variables or method names elsewhere in the code

### 2. Syntax Evolution: Version-by-Version Grammar Changes

To accurately parse specific versions of Delphi, your grammar must
support the following syntactic additions based on their release
milestones:

**Delphi 4**

- **Arrays:** Introduced dynamic array syntax (e.g., array of Integer).

- **Interface Delegation:** Introduced the implements directive. Grammar
  rule: property \<name\>: \<interface\> read \<field\> implements
  \<interface\>;

**Delphi 2005 & 2006**

- **Loops:** Introduced the for \<element\> in \<collection\> do
  iteration syntax

- **Class Architecture:** Added the class helper for syntax

- **Visibility:** Introduced the strict private and strict protected
  scoping directives within class declarations

- **Overloading:** Added syntax for operator overloading within records

**Delphi 2009**

- **Generics:** A massive grammar update introducing parameterized
  types. Grammar rule: type \<ClassName\>\<\<TypeParam\>\> = class.

- **Anonymous Methods:** Introduced closures. Grammar rule: reference to
  procedure/function and the inline declaration procedure (x: Integer)
  begin\... end; without an identifier

**Delphi 2010**

- **Attributes:** Introduced metaprogramming annotations. Grammar rule:
  \[\<AttributeName\>(\<OptionalParams\>)\] placed immediately preceding
  a type, field, or method declaration

**Delphi 10.3 Rio**

- **Inline Variables:** Fundamentally altered traditional Pascal block
  structures. Variable declarations (var) are no longer restricted to
  the header of a routine; they can be declared inline within
  begin\...end execution blocks

- **Type Inference:** Added the := initialization at the point of
  declaration (e.g., var I := 22;), allowing the parser to infer the
  type automatically

**Delphi 10.4 Sydney**

- **Custom Managed Records:** Added syntax to bind memory lifecycle
  operations to records. Grammar rule: class operator Initialize(out
  Dest: T); and class operator Finalize(var Dest: T);

**Delphi 11 Alexandria**

- **Lexical Numbers:** Updated the numeric literal parser to allow the
  underscore (\_) as a digit separator for readability (e.g.,
  1_000_000). Underscores cannot appear at the beginning of the literal

**Delphi 12 Athens**

- **Multiline Strings:** Updated the string literal parser. Multiline
  strings are now enclosed by triple quotes (\'\'\') and can span across
  physical line breaks in the source code

**Delphi 13 Florence**

- **Ternary Operator:** Transformed the if keyword from a pure statement
  into an inline expression operator. Grammar rule: \<Variable\> := if
  \<Condition\> then \<Expr\> else \<Expr\>;

- **Logical Operators:** Added is not and not in as unified comparative
  operators.

- **Directives:** Added the noreturn procedure directive to indicate a
  routine permanently interrupts execution flow.

### 3. Expression Grammar and Operator Precedence

When mapping the mathematical and logical rules of the language, your
EBNF production rules must accurately reflect Delphi\'s strict operator
precedence hierarchy to avoid ambiguity

1.  **Highest Precedence (Unary):** @, not, \^

2.  **Second Precedence (Multiplicative/Bitwise):** \*, /, div, mod,
    and, shl, shr, as

3.  **Third Precedence (Additive/Logical):** +, -, or, xor

4.  **Lowest Precedence (Relational):** =, \<\>, \<, \>, \<=, \>=, in,
    is, is not, not in

*Grammar implementation note:* The introduction of the ternary
conditional operator in Delphi 13 requires careful parser integration.
Because + and - have higher precedence than the ternary if, an
expression like if A then B else C + D is evaluated by the compiler as
if A then B else (C + D) . If a developer intends to concatenate the
result of the entire conditional evaluation, the grammar enforces the
use of parentheses: \`(if A then B else C) + D\` .
