The goal of the Object Pascal Foundation, or OPF, it to advance and promote the world-wide adoption of programming languages which use Object Pascal as their origin and for their core principles.

Object Pascal is based on the Pascal programing language invented in 1970 by [Niklaus Wirth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niklaus_Wirth), but has come along way since that time. Popular Object Pascal implementations currently in use are [Delphi](/Implementations/Delphi), [Oxygene](/Implementations/Oxygene) and [Free Pascal](/Implementations/FPC).
