The goal of the Object Pascal Foundation, or OPF for short, it to advance and promote the adoption of Object Pascal-based programming languages around the world.

Object Pascal is based on the Pascal programing language invented by [Niklaus Wirth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niklaus_Wirth), but has come along way since the 1970s. Popular Object Pascal implementations currently in use are [Delphi](/Implementations/Delphi), [Oxygene](/Implementations/Oxygene) and [Free Pascal](/Implementations/FPC).

You can read a more detailed [History](/History) of Pascal and Object Pascal [here](/History).
